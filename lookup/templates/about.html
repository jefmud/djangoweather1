<h1>About this site</h1>

<h2>Air Quality Index (AQI)</h2>
<p>The EPA developed the AQI, which reports levels of ozone, particle pollution, and other common air pollutants on the same scale. An AQI reading of 101 corresponds to a level above the national air quality standard - the higher the AQI rating, the greater the health impact.</p>

<h3>AQI colors</h3>
<p>The AQI is divided into color-coded categories and each category is identified by a simple informative descriptor. The descriptors are intended to convey information to the public about how air quality relates to public health. The table below defines the AQI categories.</p>

<pre>
AQI Numbers	AQI Category (Descriptor)	AQI Color	  Hexadecimal Color Value	Category Number
0 - 50	Good	Green	  (00e400)	1
51 - 100	Moderate	Yellow	  (ffff00)	2
101 - 150	Unhealthy for Sensitive Groups	Orange	  (ff7e00)	3
151 - 200	Unhealthy	Red	  (ff0000)	4
201 - 300	Very Unhealthy	Purple	  (8f3f97)	5
301 - 500	Hazardous	Maroon	  (7e0023)	6

<h3>Air quality observations</h3>

<p>Hourly or daily observations are measured and reported to AirNow by federal, state, local, and tribal air quality agencies. Historical (daily) AQI values are calculated using an averaging method, and real-time AQI values are based on a surrogate calculation.</p>

<h3>Data averaging</h3>
<p>The AQI reported for ground-level ozone and fine particles (PM2.5) is based on an average of hourly data. For ozone, the AQI is based on the maximum observed 8-hour average from midnight to midnight. For PM2.5, the AQI is simply the 24-hour average. For AQI values reported in real-time, before a full day's data are available, the AQI is based on a surrogate calculation.</p>
